# WHAT TO TRY:
Summary:
    - Keep running Random sweeps 
    - Run Clustering solutions on Gradient (The sripts should be working)
    - Update Dashboards to Polars optimization.
    - New cluster center script, with Euclidean, DTW, and k-Medoids(DTW) barycenter.

Details:
    - 10 Random Sweeps for new pW Rwanda and Kenya datasets:
        - lstm_ae: Kenya [Done], Rwanda [Done]
        - cnn_ConvEmb: Kenya [Done], Rwanda [Done]    
        - cnn_AE: Kenya [Done], Rwanda [Done]
        - fc_n2d: Kenya [Done], Rwanda [Done]        
        
    - Clustering Soltuions:
        - Run Solutions with and without UMAP:
            - Baseline MBP: [0/4]
            - Baseline kMeans: [0/4]
            - LSTM-AE: [0/4]
            - CNN-ConvEmb: [0/4]
            - CNN-AE: [0/4]
            - FC-N2D: [0/4]            
            
    - DashBoards
        - Update to new file Structure [TBC]
        - [Done] Improve data struture to upload only necessary stuff:
            - Reconstructions-df
            - MSE-df
            - kMeans_centroids-df
            - Clustering_Results-df        
        - [Done] Save kMeans centroids (on clustering space and the original space) 
    
# Idea: [Done]

Baseline comparisson strategy:
Compare both the Recontruction Error and Clustering Validation against Mean Based Predict (MBP).
Mean Based Prediction meaning, replacing the data with it's mean value (per window), so each window is a flat line at it's original mean.
For the Recontruction Error, this will signal whether the model found a meaningful compression beyond a mean.
For the Clustering, one can do the clustering with just the means per window. If the Clustering outcome of a Auto-Encoder appproach is less informative than the MBP approach, then it's pointless.
