# WHAT TO TRY:
    - Make a LSTM AE, basic just to show we tryied. (check Dimitrios architecture)
    - Clean Up Sweep Laucher:
        - Zscore outside
        - Load AE model at the top (not this duplicated set up)
    - Review Experiment Set Up and Create Fixed datasets (Not preprocessing on training, e.g, zscoring)
    - Fine tune Hyperparameters (i.e., reduce variables)(Per Architecture if needed):
        - Single Activationa type (little effect)
        - Choose Optimizer (Nadam, looking better for CNNs)
