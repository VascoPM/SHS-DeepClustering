# WHAT TO TRY:
    - 10 Random Sweeps for new pW Rwanda and Kenya datasets:
        - lstm_ae: Rwanda [TBC], Kenya [TBC]
        - cnn_ConvEmb: Rwanda [TBD], Kenya [TBC]    
        - cnn_AE: Rwanda [TBC], Kenya [TBC]
        - fc_n2d: Rwanda [TBC], Kenya [TBC]        
    
    
# Idea:

Baseline comparisson strategy:
Compare both the Recontruction Error and Clustering Validation against Mean Based Predict (MBP).
Mean Based Prediction meaning, replacing the data with it's mean value (per window), so each window is a flat line at it's original mean.
For the Recontruction Error, this will signal whether the model found a meaningful compression beyond a mean.
For the Clustering, one can do the clustering with just the means per window. If the Clustering outcome of a Auto-Encoder appproach is less informative than the MBP approach, then it's pointless.
